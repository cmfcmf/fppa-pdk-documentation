WRITER:

PRESENCE-CHECK of IC (automatically executed every second by programer):
 - required pins connected: VDD,GND,PA.3,PA.4
 - NOTE: before checking all pins are tested for shortcuts 
   -> Do not connect GND pin of programer socket to osciloscope, use GND from programer board instead!
  - uses fixed low voltage (3.3V) for VDD only

BLANK-CHECK (IDE button):
 - required pins connected: VDD,GND,PA.3,PA.4,PA.5,PA.6
 - different voltage levels (max. 4.6V on VDD)
 - apx. 1 second activity

VERIFY (IDE button):
 - required pins connected: VDD,GND,PA.3,PA.4,PA.5,PA.6
 - different voltage levels (max. 4.6V on VDD)
 - apx. 1 second activity

--> Logic-Analyzer can be used to capture presence check, blank check and verify of PMS154B.
